# SpeakerRecognition
Speaker Recognition is a technique that could be used to disambiguate two
or several speakers participating in a conversation. One of practical
applications of this technique could be to create two or more channels for
transcription of speech into text so that a transcript of a conversation
accurately indicates which text belongs to which speaker or conversation
participant. One could use this technique in all kinds of security and
utilitarian applications as well.

We will be experimenting with three major COTS speaker recognition software:
Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform
