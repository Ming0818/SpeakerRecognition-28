# SpeakerRecognition
Speaker Recognition is a technique that could be used to disambiguate two
or several speakers participating in a conversation. One of practical
applications of this technique could be to create two or more channels for
transcription of speech into text so that a transcript of a conversation
accurately indicates which text belongs to which speaker or conversation
participant. One could use this technique in all kinds of security and
utilitarian applications as well.
